The higher the quality of the PR, the easier it is for the maintainer to review
the code, suggests changes and get the PR merged.

**NOTE about AI-LLM usage:** I have nothing against the use of these tools.
However, many people are unable to properly control their outputs.
In practice, these tools often modifies too much. With this in mind:

* No [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding). I prefer that
  you code manually and understand exactly what you are doing.
  If you are unable to code without an LLM, open an issue and clearly explain
  what's wrong or what could be implemented.
* If there is a comment in the code, it is very likely to be important to me
  (the maintainer). Equally important are variable names, function names etc.
  If the LLM is going to change variable names, remove comments or reorganize
  the code just for the sake of it, I'll close the PR immediately.
