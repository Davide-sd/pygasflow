Basics of Aerothermodynamics, Solutions
---------------------------------------

Here are the solutions to a few end-of-chapter problems of
*Basics of Aerothermodynamics, Ernst Heinrich Hirschel*

The goal is to showcase the capabilities of **pygasflow**.

The following python module were used:

* `pint <https://github.com/hgrecco/pint>`_ : it allows
  to define, operate and manipulate physical quantities.
* `ambiance <https://github.com/airinnova/ambiance>`_ : a full implementation
  of the ICAO standard atmosphere 1993.
* `sympy <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/>`_ : for symbolic computations.
* `sympy_equation <https://github.com/Davide-sd/sympy-equation>`_ :
  an extension of SymPy that allows to algebraically manipulate equations.

**If you are a student**, please note that the only way to learn is to
understand the underlying concepts and apply them with hard work and
determination. Shortcuts won't do you any good.
