Modern Compressible Flow, Solutions
-----------------------------------

Here are the solutions to a few end-of-chapter problems of
*Modern Compressible Flow With Historical Perspective, Third Edition, John D. Anderson Jr.*

The goal is to showcase the capabilities of **pygasflow**.
The author of this module is reasonably confident about the correctness
of most of these exercise.

The module `pint <https://github.com/hgrecco/pint>`_ was used as it allows
to define, operate and manipulate physical quantities.

**If you are a student**, please note that the only way to learn is to
understand the underlying concepts and apply them with hard work and
determination. Shortcuts won't do you any good.
